## Configuring Launchpad
Required Hardware: [Novation Launchpad MKIII](https://novationmusic.com/products/launchpad-pro-mk3)

The launchpad is the controller in which the game is played. The controller is split into five buttons, corresponding to the cardinal directions - north (red), south (green), east (blue) and west (yellow). The button in the middle is to start the game.
