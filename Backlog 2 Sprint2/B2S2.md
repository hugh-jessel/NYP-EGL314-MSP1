## Overview
In this sprint of the second backlog, the tasks are to:
 - Configure LaunchPad
 - LaunchPad MIDI to Raspberry Pi
 - MIDI to Reaper DAW
 - Foundation for a Reaction Training Game
   
Sample codes can be found in the 'Backlog 2 Sprint2' Folder
 - [gui.py](gui.py) - A tkinter-based GUI with controls for L-ISA Controller and GrandMA3
 - [midi.py](midi.py) - Main file which defines the base logic of the game and integrates the other files together
 - [osc_client_Grandma3.py](osc_client_Grandma3.py) - Send messages from the GUI to the GrandMA3 via OSC
 - [osc_client_LISA.py](osc_client_LISA.py) - Send messages from the GUI to L-ISA Controller via OSC
 - [play_stop.py](play_stop.py) - Defines functions necessary to start and stop the game
 - [reaper_markers.py](reaper_markers.py) - Defines functions to control Reaper DAW, projectiles, deflecting, win and fail conditions for the game

## Launchpad Configuration
Required Hardware: [Novation Launchpad MKIII](https://novationmusic.com/products/launchpad-pro-mk3)

The launchpad is the controller in which the game is played. The controller is split into five buttons, corresponding to the cardinal directions - north (red), south (green), east (blue) and west (yellow). The button in the middle is to start the game.

To import the controller layout, download the [preset file](launchpad-preset.syx) and visit the [Novation components website](https://components.novationmusic.com/launchpad-pro-mk3/)
    
1. Click New Custom Mode

## Launchpad MIDI to Raspberry Pi
This section will guide you on how to be able to send Launchpad MIDI to your Raspberry Pi. To achieve this, it can be found in both [StartGame.py](./StartGame.py) and [midi.py](./midi.py) where `import mido` is used to import the mido library as to enable MIDI controls from the LaunchPad to the Raspberry Pi.

In these files, using the mido library the commands are
- `msg.type == note_on` - To detect if the different notes/buttons are pressed.
- `msg.type == note_off` - To detect when the button is released.
- `if msg.note == 63` - The number is to be changed based on which note is being pressed, differentiating: North, South, East and West.

## MIDI to Reaper DAW
This section will guide you on how MIDI to Reaper DAW works. This occurs by receiving the MIDI commands from the LaunchPad and sending it from the Raspberry Pi to Reaper DAW. The file that you should be referencing to is **[reaper_markers.py](./reaper_markers.py)** where on Lines 19 and 20 you will need to ensure the `PI_A_ADDR` and `PORT` are matching that of the Laptop with Reaper DAW.

```
PI_A_ADDR = "192.168.254.30"		# wlan ip
PORT = 6800
```

In order to execute the command, on line 24 the code `msg = float(1)` is to Trigger the TRUE value.

In the different functions in the codes, each function jumps to different markers. E.g Marker 1 etc, with the addr being the different commands to jump to the varying markers.

After that, in [StartGame.py](./StartGame.py) and [midi.py](./midi.py), when certain notes are pressed at the various timings, it will jump to the different markers. Combining the Reaper commands with the Launchpad MIDI.
