## Overview
In this sprint of the third backlog, the tasks are to:
1. Slave Pi Preparation
2. Cable Fabrication

Sample codes can be found in the 'Backlog 3 Sprint1' Folder

* [Laser_Gui.py](./Laser_Gui.py) - A GUI to control the Laser Modules, including Turning On/Off, slow laser sequence and fast laser sequence.
* [osclaser_server_V2.py](./osclaser_server_V2.py) - A server to be ran on the **Master Raspberry Pi** to send a command to the Slave Raspberry Pis.
* [osclaser_trigger_V2.py](./osclaser_trigger_V2.py) - A server to be ran on the **Slave Raspberry Pis** to receive commands from  the Master Raspberry Pi

## Hardware Setup
In this project, we are placing 2 lasers on each of the 12 speakers in the classroom, pointed at a mirror on the diaphragm to produce patterns and shapes from the vibration produced from the music played. <br>

On the middle speaker of each side, there will be a Raspberry Pi 4 as a **Slave Raspberry Pi** to receive commands from the Master Raspberry Pi in order to trigger OSC commands of GPIO.HIGH or GPIO.LOW to various relay channels which would turn the respective lasers on or off. <br>

The setup of the lasers should follow the diagram shown below:

In case reference is needed, you can refer to the Raspberry Pi 4's GPIO pinouts as shown below:
<details><summary><b>Raspberry Pi 4 GPIO Pinouts</b></summary>
  <br><img src="./Assets/RaspiGPIOpinouts.png" width=550 height =300 >
</details>

With reference to the GPIO pinouts, we are able to begin the hardware connections. Before we begin, you need:
* 2x Laser Module
* 2 Channel Relay Module
* Raspberry Pi 4
Please connect these hardware in the manner as shown below.
<details><summary><b>Laser Modules Connection Schematic</b></summary>
  <br><img src="./Assets/LaserConnectionSchematic.png" width=450 height =300>
  <br><img src="./Assets/gpiomapping.png"><br>
  In reference to the images above, the Laser Connection Schematic currently has the relay on Normally Closed (NC), however, we will have to swap the connection from NC to Normally Open (NO).
</details>

We will be controlling the lasers via a UI as well which can be found in [Laser_Gui.py](./Laser_Gui.py) which has to include functions for turning the Laser On and Off, activating a faster laser sequence and a slow laser sequence.

## Creating a Slow/Fast Laser Sequence
Now that we are able to turn the laser On and Off, we can create an automated sequence for the laser to follow a set amount of beats.
1. Define Turning On and Off the Laser in the new file
   Turning <b>ON</b> the laser:
    ```
    import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
    
    def laser_on():
      GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
      GPIO.setup(21, GPIO.OUT)
    
      GPIO.output(21, GPIO.LOW)
      print('Relay ON - The relay will stay on until the program is terminated')
    ```
      
   Turning <b>OFF</b> the Laser:
   ```
    import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
   
    def laser_off():
      GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
      GPIO.setup(21, GPIO.OUT)
    
      GPIO.output(21, GPIO.HIGH)  # Turn off the relay
      print('Relay OFF - Cleaning up GPIO.')
      GPIO.cleanup()
   ```
2. Counting the beats:

This can be found in both files of [Fast_Violin.py](./Fast_Violin.py) and [Slow_Creep.py](./Slow_Creep.py) where you can can create a counter as shown below to follow a set bpm that can be called in [Laser_Gui.py](./Laser_Gui.py). In the counter when called, the values that can be set are the bpm you are intending to seek and the duration of how long you want the code to run for.
   ```
   import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
   import time

   def counter(bpm, duration):
      beat_gap = 60/bpm # Time interval between beats
      count = 0
      start_time = time.time()
      while time.time() - start_time < duration :
          time.sleep(beat_gap)
          count += 1
          if count % 2 == 0:
            laser_on()
          elif count == 2:
            laser_off()
          else:
            laser_on()
    print(f"Counted {count} beats in {duration} seconds.")
    laser_off()
    ```
