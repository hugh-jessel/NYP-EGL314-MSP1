## Overview
In this sprint of the third backlog, the tasks are to:
1. Slave Pi Preparation
2. Cable Fabrication

Sample codes can be found in the 'Backlog 3 Sprint1' Folder

* [Laser_Gui.py](./Laser_Gui.py) - A GUI to control the Laser Modules, including Turning On/Off using both With and Without the server.
* [osclaser_server_V2.py](./osclaser_server_V2.py) - A server to be ran on the **Master Raspberry Pi** to send a command to the Slave Raspberry Pis.
* [osclaser_trigger_V2.py](./osclaser_trigger_V2.py) - A server to be ran on the **Slave Raspberry Pis** to receive commands from  the Master Raspberry Pi

## Hardware Setup
In this project, we are placing 2 lasers on each of the 12 speakers in the classroom, pointed at a mirror on the diaphragm to produce patterns and shapes from the vibration produced from the music played. <br>

On the middle speaker of each side, there will be a Raspberry Pi 4 as a **Slave Raspberry Pi** to receive commands from the Master Raspberry Pi in order to trigger OSC commands of GPIO.HIGH or GPIO.LOW to various relay channels which would turn the respective lasers on or off. <br>

In case reference is needed, you can refer to the Raspberry Pi 4's GPIO pinouts as shown below:

</details>

With reference to the GPIO pinouts, we are able to begin the hardware connections. Before we begin, you need:
* 6x Laser Module
* 3x 2 Channel Relay Module
* Raspberry Pi 4
* Breadboard
Please connect these hardware in the manner as shown below.

</details>

We will be controlling the lasers via a UI as well which can be found in [Laser_Gui.py](./Laser_Gui.py) which has to include functions for turning the Laser On and Off, with or without the server Pi running.
