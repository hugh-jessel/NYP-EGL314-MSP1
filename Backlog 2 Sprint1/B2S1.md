  1. Create a directory folder for the [GUI](./Backlog%202%20Sprint1/Gui.py), [Markers](./Backlog%202%20Sprint1/markers.py) and [Play_stop](./Backlog%202%20Sprint1/play_stop.py) files. For example, we can name this folder *reaper*.

     ```
     mkdir reaper
     ```

  2. Please copy the files below into the folder directory `~/reaper`

     ```
     Gui.py
     markers.py
     play_stop.py
     ```

  3. Edit the IP address in the various files to that of the Laptop that is running reaper

     - Line 19 of `markers.py`
       
       ```
       PI_A_ADDR = "REAPER LAPTOP IP ADDR"
       ```
       
     - Line 19 of `play_stop.py`

       ```
       PI_A_ADDR = "REAPER LAPTOP IP ADDR"
       ```

  4. Run the GUI file, where it has called markers and play_stop functions from the markers.py and play_stop.py. If the files were installed properly and the OSC was configured correctly, the Play/Stop button will Play and Stop the track, and the marker buttons will send the playback to the various markers.

     ```
       python3 Gui.py
     ```
