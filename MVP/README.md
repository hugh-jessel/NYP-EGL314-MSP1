## Overview
This repository contains all the notable assets, codes and others for our Minimum Viable Product (MVP) in Week 14 that covers Station 4 - Reaction Training.

In the Minimum Viable Product, we will be using a Master Station, shared with the other teams. In which in the venue, there are 12 Speakers and the participant will be standing in the middle of the room to play their game.

For the Minimum Viable Product, the demonstration will feature a full run through of the game. Including 3 stages, a start, a restart and a pass and fail. Alongside that, there will also be a GUI to trigger a laser show.

## Code Files
In this folder, there are multiple python files. We will take a dive into the details of the codes.

Below, there are more detailed explanations of the codes in their respective uses.
<details><summary><h2>Laser Show</h2></summary>

In the laser show, it mainly revolves around [laser_gui.py](./Laser_Gui.py), [osclaser_server_V2.py](./osclaser_server_V2.py) and [osclaser_trigger_V2.py](./osclaser_trigger_V2.py).

For the laser show, this is how the code hierarchy would look like:
```mermaid
graph LR
A[laser_gui.py] --> B[osclaser_server_V2.py]
B --> C[osclaser_trigger_V2.py]
```
<details><summary><h3>laser_gui.py</h3></summary>
  
In laser_gui.py, there are a few things to note. Firstly, are the imports. Importing in the pythonosc library to be able to communicate with the Master Raspberry Pi and the Slave Raspberry Pi after. Also importing the [reaper_markers.py](./reaper_markers.py) code. These are all seen from lines 1 to 7.
  
```
from pythonosc import osc_server, dispatcher

from pythonosc import udp_client

import tkinter as tk

import reaper_markers

# import RPi.GPIO as GPIO

import time
```
With that, there is a need to set a send_addr, send_port and addr to be able to send a message to the Master Raspberry Pi, this can be seen from lines 131 to 133 where in this example, the send_addr is listed as `192.168.254.49`, then send_port listed as `2000` and the addr listed as `/print` which are the respective IP address and port of the Master Raspberry Pi
```
send_addr = "192.168.254.49"
send_port = 2000
addr = "/print"
```

Slightly late down in the code, there is another IP address and port used to send commands to a Neopixel LED Strip as well. This was set to `192.168.254.242` and the port is listed as `2005` following the functions above. This can be seen from lines 185 to 194.
```
def send_color(receiver_ip, receiver_port, r, g, b):  # Sends colour commands to the Neopixel
    client = udp_client.SimpleUDPClient(receiver_ip, receiver_port) 
    client.send_message("/color", [r, g, b])

def send_brightness(receiver_ip, receiver_port, brightness): # Sends brightness commands to the Neopixel
    client = udp_client.SimpleUDPClient(receiver_ip, receiver_port)
    client.send_message("/brightness", [brightness])

PI_B_ADDR = "192.168.254.242"  # Change to your RPi's IP address
PORT2 = 2005
```

After this, are the functions for the lasers. In here, we will just take a random function as an example since majority of them are similar.
```
def AllOffOneByOne():
    msg = ["1,1,0", "1,2,0", "2,1,0", "2,2,0", "3,1,0", "3,2,0",
           "4,1,0", "4,2,0", "5,1,0", "5,2,0", "6,1,0", "6,2,0",
           "7,1,0", "7,2,0", "8,1,0", "8,2,0", "9,1,0", "9,2,0",
           "10,1,0", "10,2,0", "11,1,0", "11,2,0", "12,1,0", "12,2,0"] # The messages to be sent to the Master Pi
    
    y = int(0) # Creating a variable called y.
    while y < len(msg): # A while loop that stays true for as long as y is not longer than the array called msg.
        time.sleep(0.03) # Can be removed based on whether you want a delay in between actions. e.g From first message to second message
        send_message(send_addr, send_port, addr, msg[y]) # To send command to Master Raspberry Pi
        print(msg[y]) 
        y += 1 # To increase the variable called y.

        if y == len(msg): # An if statement, when y is equals to the length of the array, it will stop the while loop.
            break 
```
Functions like these are then integrated into one big function for the laser show which can be seen here, along with explanations of what different lines do.
```
def lasersequence():
    try:
        Laser_SequenceRP() # A function that calls for Reaper to start playing the music.

    count = 0 # Start a variable count
    start_time = time.time() # Set start_time as the present time that the code was ran.

    try:
        while time.time() - start_time < 30: # For as long as when the current time minus starting time duration is lesser than 30, the loop will continue
            time.sleep(beat_gap) # To set the interval between actions as the gap between beats

            if count % 2 == 0: # Does it every even number.
                send_color(PI_B_ADDR, PORT2, 0, 0, 0) # Set no colour to Neopixels
                send_brightness(PI_B_ADDR, PORT2, 0) # Set no brightness to Neopixels

<details><summary><h3>osclaser_server_V2.py</h3></summary>

In osclaser_server_V2.py, it is a code to be put into the Master Raspberry Pi to carry out 2 functions. One, receiving the commands from the Laser_Gui. Two, to send the received commands to the Slave Raspberry Pi which holds [osclaser_trigger_V2.py](./osclaser_trigger_V2.py). First, the receiver_ip and receiver_port is to be set to the respective values of the Master Raspberry Pi which in this example is `192.168.254.49` and `2003`. This was set on lines 10 and 11 of the code as seen below:
```
receiver_ip = "192.168.254.49" # Team A
receiver_port = 2003
```
Following this, is the function to enable the Master Raspberry Pi to receive the commands and re-send them out to the Slave Raspberry Pi. There will be explanation next to the respective codes to talk about their functions seen from lines 13 to 35.
```
# this function prints the arguments in received OSC messages
def print_args(addr, *args):
  if addr == "/print": # An If statement to detect for the messages with the address /print
    print(f"message received {args[0]}")
    msg = args[0] 
    var = args[0].split(',')
    spk = int(var[0].strip()) 
    addr = "/trigger" # Sets a new address before sending out the message to slave raspberry pi

    if 1 <= spk <= 3:
       send_addr = "192.168.254.197" #Team C (Updates the send_addr and send_port to the respective Slave Raspberry Pis)
       send_port = 2001
    elif 4 <= spk <= 6:
      send_addr = "192.168.254.101" #Team E
      send_port = 2002
    elif 7 <= spk <= 9:
      send_addr = "192.168.254.72" #Team B
      send_port = 2003
    elif 10 <= spk <= 12:
      send_addr = "192.168.254.236" #Team F
      send_port = 2004
    
    osc_client.send_message(send_addr, send_port, addr, msg)
```
</details>

<details><summary><h3>osclaser_trigger_V2.py</h3></summary>

In osclaser_trigger_V2.py, it is a code to be put into the Slave Raspberry Pis, this code will receive the commands from the Master Raspberry Pi and followed by using RPi.GPIO to trigger the different relay channels that will then turn on and off the lasers respectively. Since there is going to be a use of the RPi.GPIO pins, there will be a need to setup these GPIO pins as shown below and can be found from Lines 10 to 23:
```
# GPIO pin setup
r1_c1 = 21
r1_c2 = 20
r2_c1 = 26
r2_c2 = 19
r3_c1 = 3
r3_c2 = 2

GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
GPIO.setup(r1_c1, GPIO.OUT, initial=GPIO.HIGH) # Default on HIGH since the Relay is set on Normally Open.
GPIO.setup(r1_c2, GPIO.OUT, initial=GPIO.HIGH)
GPIO.setup(r2_c1, GPIO.OUT, initial=GPIO.HIGH)
GPIO.setup(r2_c2, GPIO.OUT, initial=GPIO.HIGH)
GPIO.setup(r3_c1, GPIO.OUT, initial=GPIO.HIGH)
GPIO.setup(r3_c2, GPIO.OUT, initial=GPIO.HIGH)
```
Following that, since it is receiving commands from the Master Raspberry Pi via OSC, there is a need to set a receiving_ip and receiving_port. In this example we will be using Team B's addresses set to `192.168.254.72` and `2003` respectively. This can be set at lines 26 and 27.
```
# Change the receiver_ip value to your RPi's IP address
receiver_ip = "192.168.254.72" # IP address of your Pi
receiver_port = 2003 # Team C: 2001, Team E: 2002, Team B: 2003, Team F: 2004
```
After this, would be the function to control the relays. Details and explanations of the code will appear as comments below:
```
# This function handles the received OSC messages and controls the GPIO pins
def control_relay(addr, *args):
    if addr == "/trigger": # Detects for messages with the address "/trigger"
        msg = args[0].split(',') # Splits the message received from the Master Raspberry Pi
        spk = int(msg[0].strip())
        channel = int(msg[1].strip()) # Will assign the value based on the split from the msg (e.g spk, channel, value) 
        value = int(msg[2].strip())  # First value of msg array will be speaker number,
                                      # second will be the relay channel and last will be the value to turn it on or Off
        print(f"The spk {spk} controlling channel {channel} and the value is {value}")
        if spk == 7: # Change according to spk number (refer to S536 drawing)
            if channel == 1:

<details><summary><h2>Reaction Time Game</summary>

In the reaction time game , it mainly revolves around [StartGame.py](./StartGame.py) and [Gamestart_wipV2.py](./Gamestart_wipV2.py)

For the reactiom time game , this is how the code hierarchy would look like:
```mermaid
graph LR
A[StartGame.py] --> B[Gamestart_wipV2.py]
```



<details><summary><h3>StartGame.py</h3></summary>

In StartGame.py, the first thing to note are the imports, from lines 1 to 8, [reaper_markers](./reaper_markers.py), [Lisa_GrandMa3_Functions](./Lisa_GrandMa3_Functions.py) and [Gamestart_wipV2](./Gamestart_wipV2.py)

```
#Imports
import mido 
import reaper_markers
import sys
import Lisa_GrandMa3_Functions
import Gamestart_wipV2
from pythonosc import osc_server, dispatcher
import time
```
Right after the imports, is the main function of this file, the most important part of the code is from lines 25 to 35

```
if msg.note == 67: #start
    print ('Game Start')
    
    reaper_markers.play_stop() # Stop any currently playing track 
    
    Lisa_GrandMa3_Functions.clear_all()   
    Lisa_GrandMa3_Functions.clear_all()
    Lisa_GrandMa3_Functions.playing()
    Lisa_GrandMa3_Functions.playing()
    reaper_markers.startMk()
    Gamestart_wipV2.launchpad_listen()
```
The code simply requires input from launchpad, specifically in this case msg.note == 67 to trigger this if statement, sending messages to GrandMa3, Reaper and the function in [Gamestart_wipV2,py](./Gamestart_wipV2.py), launchpad_listen() to start the game function.

This code is what we use to listen to our device, in this case the `"Launchpad Pro MK3:Launchpad Pro MK3 LPProMK3 MIDI 28:0"`, which will change based on what device you are using. If no device is connected, it will print out a message saying so, otherwise it will begin listening to messages from the device.

It encompasses the core functionality of the other sections in this functions. When a projectile is fired out from the speaker, a count begins to track if the player reacts in time. 
Afterwards it moves on to check if the player presses the right button in under 3 seconds, which if true they deflect the projectile, stoping the count for their reaction speed and jumping to a random projectile marker and this repeats until they either fail to react in time, press the wrong note, or they pass to the next stage
