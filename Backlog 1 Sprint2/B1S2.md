</h1>

## Overview
In this sprint of the first backlog, the tasks are to:
1. Configure a Laser Switching Module
2. A Slow Laser Sequence (<69bpm)
3. A Fast Laser Sequence (>69bpm)

Sample codes can be found in the 'Backlog 1 Sprint2' Folder

## Configuring a Laser Switching Module
In this project, we are using a Raspberry Pi 4. Below is a picture of the GPIO Pinouts.

With reference to the GPIO pinouts, we are able to begin the hardware connections. Before we begin, you need:
* 2x Laser Module
* 2 Channel Relay Module
* Raspberry Pi 4
* Breadboard
