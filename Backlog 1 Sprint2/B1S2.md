## Overview
In this sprint of the first backlog, the tasks are to:
1. Configure a Laser Switching Module
2. A Slow Laser Sequence (<69bpm)
3. A Fast Laser Sequence (>69bpm)

Sample codes can be found in the 'Backlog 1 Sprint2' Folder

## Configuring a Laser Switching Module
In this project, we are using a Raspberry Pi 4. Below is a picture of the GPIO Pinouts.

</details>

With reference to the GPIO pinouts, we are able to begin the hardware connections. Before we begin, you need:
* 2x Laser Module
* 2 Channel Relay Module
* Raspberry Pi 4
Please connect these hardware in the manner as shown below.
<details><summary><b>Laser Modules Connection Schematic</b></summary>

  In reference to the images above, the Laser Connection Schematic currently has the relay on Normally Closed (NC), however, we will have to swap the connection from NC to Normally Open (NO).

  
  This means to control the laser as shown in [Laser_Gui.py](./Laser_Gui.py) from lines 58 to 71,

  
  1. Turning <b>ON</b> the laser:
  
    def laser_on():
      GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
      GPIO.setup(21, GPIO.OUT)
    
      GPIO.output(21, GPIO.LOW)
      print('Relay ON - The relay will stay on until the program is terminated')
      
  2. Turning <b>OFF</b> the Laser:
     
    def laser_off():
      GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
      GPIO.setup(21, GPIO.OUT)
    
      GPIO.output(21, GPIO.HIGH)  # Turn off the relay
      print('Relay OFF - Cleaning up GPIO.')
      GPIO.cleanup()
